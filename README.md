Noisy Quantum Process Tomography (MSci project)
================================


NoisyQPT contains the code library (rather a semi-related collection of scripts) for synthetic data generation and jupyter 
notebooks for data-science like analysis, as part of my MSci project. It essentially implements multinomial sampling and semi-definite programming to benchmark quantum process tomography (QPT). This is then used to
optimize the input stage of QPT by searching through input state space via brute-force and intelligently following some symmetry based arguments.
After some further testing, I will open up an issues and contributions channel so that this repository might have some further functional use for others.
